    "### 💡 What the question is asking\n",
    "You need to **create a function** called `translate(text, mapping)` that turns **normal text into leetspeak** (a style where letters are replaced by symbols or numbers).\n",

    "```python\n",
    "mapping = {'a': '4', 'e': '3', 'i': '1', 'o': '0', 's': '5'}\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "### 🧠 What the function should do\n",
    "Your function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def translate(text: str, mapping: dict[str, str]) -> str:\n",
    "```\n",
    "should:\n",
    "1. **Go through each letter** in `text`.\n",
    "2. **Check if it’s a lowercase letter** found in the `mapping` dictionary.\n",
    "   * If yes → replace it with the mapped value.\n",
    "   * If not → keep it the same.\n",
    "3. **Return** the new translated string.\n",
    "---\n",
    "### ⚙️ Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mapping = {'a': '4', 'e': '3', 'i': '1', 'o': '0', 's': '5'}\n",
    "print(translate(\"easy\", mapping))\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ **Expected output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "34sy\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "* `e → 3`\n",
    "* `a → 4`\n",
    "* `s → s` (if not in lowercase or not mapped, it stays)\n",
    "* `y → y` (unchanged)\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 🧩 Important concept: **String immutability**\n",
    "In Python, **strings cannot be changed once created** — this means you can’t directly edit a character inside a string.\n",
    "That’s why if you try:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text[0] = 'x'\n",
    "```\n",
    "it will cause an error.\n",
    "So when we \"replace\" letters, we’re actually **building a new string**.\n",
    "---\n",
    "### ⚡ Efficient way to do it\n",
    "Instead of adding characters one by one (like `result += new_char`),\n",
    "which is **slow** because Python makes a new string each time,\n",
    "we use a **list + join** approach:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def translate(text, mapping):\n",
    "    result = []\n",
    "    for ch in text:\n",
    "        if ch in mapping:\n",
    "            result.append(mapping[ch])\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            result.append(ch)\n",
    "    return ''.join(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is **faster and more memory-efficient**.\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 🧾 Anchor Concepts Mentioned:\n",
    "* **replace** → swapping characters\n",
    "* **iteration strategies** → using a loop to go through each character\n",
    "* **efficiency** → using `list` + `join` instead of repeated string concatenation\n",
    "---\n",
    "### ✅ Summary:\n",
    "You’re asked to:\n",
    "1. Make a leetspeak translator using a mapping dictionary.\n",
    "2. Only replace lowercase letters.\n",
    "3. Explain that strings are immutable, so you use a list and `\"\".join()` to build the final result efficiently.\n",
    "4. The expected output is a new “leet” version of the input text.\n",
    "Would you like me to show you the **complete working code** for this function too?\n",
    "\n",
    "Critique:\n",
    "\n",
    "Correctness: Explains leetspeak conversion accurately and shows expected behavior clearly (\"easy\" → \"34sy\"). The logic for character replacement matches the mapping dictionary and correctly handles unmapped characters by leaving them unchanged.\n",
    "Complexity: Runs in O(n) time and O(1) extra space since each character is checked once. The use of a list and \"\".join()\" makes it efficient and avoids repeated string concatenation.\n",
    "Robustness: Works correctly for both mapped and unmapped characters. Could improve by handling uppercase letters or adding input validation.\n",
    "Readability: Well-structured and easy to follow. Clear examples and explanations make the logic understandable. Minor improvement: add a brief docstring or inline comments for clarity.\n",
    "Faithfulness: Uses string iteration, replacement, and immutability concepts consistent with our lecture notes on efficient string handling. Reference:Lesson 5\n",

    "Sure! Let’s break that down simply 👇\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 💡 **Goal**\n",
    "You need to write a Python function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fmt_money(x: float) -> str:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function will take a number (like `1234.5`) and return a **formatted money string** like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"1,234.50\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "It must include:\n",
    "* **Commas** for thousands\n",
    "* **Two decimal places**\n",
    "* **Banker’s rounding (ties-to-even)**\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 💰 **What is banker’s rounding (ties-to-even)?**\n",
    "When a number ends exactly halfway between two choices — for example, `2.5` (between `2` and `3`) — Python’s default rounding rule is **ties-to-even**.\n",
    "That means:\n",
    "* `2.5` → **2** (because 2 is even)\n",
    "* `3.5` → **4** (because 4 is even)\n",
    "So it “rounds to the nearest even number” to prevent rounding bias in financial calculations.\n",
    "You can test this easily:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(round(2.5))  # 2\n",
    "print(round(3.5))  # 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 🧮 **Formatting for currency**\n",
    "You can use Python’s format specifier for commas and two decimals:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f\"{x:,.2f}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "* `,` → adds commas\n",
    "* `.2f` → keeps two digits after the decimal\n",
    "---\n",
    "### ✅ **Putting it together**\n",
    "Here’s a simple implementation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fmt_money(x: float) -> str:\n",
    "    return f\"{round(x, 2):,.2f}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 🧪 **Test cases**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(fmt_money(1234.5))     # 1,234.50\n",
    "print(fmt_money(2.5))        # 2.00  (ties to even)\n",
    "print(fmt_money(3.5))        # 4.00  (ties to even)\n",
    "print(fmt_money(1234567.899))# 1,234,567.90\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "So in short:\n",
    "> **Banker’s rounding** avoids bias by rounding .5 to the nearest *even* number, and **`f\"{x:,.2f}\"`** ensures proper money formatting.\n",
    "Critique:\n",

    "Complexity: The function runs in O(1) time and space since formatting and rounding are constant-time operations.\n",

    "Readability: The code and explanation are clean, short, and easy to understand. A short docstring could improve clarity.\n",

    "Sure! Let’s break this down simply 👇\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 💡 **Goal**\n",
    "You need to make a **command-line program** (`exponent.py`) that:\n",
    "1. Asks the user for **two values** — a base and an exponent.\n",
    "2. **Checks** if both inputs are valid numbers.\n",
    "3. If valid, **computes `a ** b`** (a raised to the power of b).\n",
    "4. If not valid, shows a **friendly error message** instead of crashing.\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 🧠 **Step-by-step explanation**\n",
    "#### 1. **Read user input**\n",
    "You’ll use `input()` to get values from the user:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = input(\"Enter the base: \")\n",
    "b = input(\"Enter the exponent: \")\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### 2. **Validate input**\n",
    "Before doing math, you must ensure the inputs are **numbers** (not text like “hello”).\n",
    "You can do this by trying to convert them to `float`.\n",
    "If conversion fails, Python raises a `ValueError`, so we’ll handle that safely.\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### 3. **Handle errors gracefully**\n",
    "Use a `try-except` block to catch errors:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    a = float(a)\n",
    "    b = float(b)\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Please enter valid numeric values.\")\n",
    "    exit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This stops the program with a clear message instead of a traceback.\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### 4. **Compute the exponent**\n",
    "If both are valid, calculate:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = a ** b\n",
    "print(f\"{a} raised to the power of {b} is {result}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "### ✅ **Complete working example**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# exponent.py\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    a = float(input(\"Enter the base: \"))\n",
    "    b = float(input(\"Enter the exponent: \"))\n",
    "    result = a ** b\n",
    "    print(f\"{a} raised to the power of {b} is {result}\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Please enter valid numeric values.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 🧪 **Example runs**\n",
    "**Valid input:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter the base: 2\n",
    "Enter the exponent: 3\n",
    "2.0 raised to the power of 3.0 is 8.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Invalid input:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter the base: two\n",
    "Enter the exponent: 3\n",
    "Error: Please enter valid numeric values.\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 📝 **Key ideas**\n",
    "* `try` and `except` prevent program crashes.\n",
    "* `float()` helps accept both integers and decimals.\n",
    "* `a ** b` performs exponentiation.\n",
    "* The program gives **clear, friendly output** for both success and error cases.\n",
    "Critique\n",
    "Correctness: The explanation is accurate and aligns with the expected logic of reading inputs, validating data, and computing exponents. \n",
    "Complexity: The program runs in O(1) time and space since it performs only basic arithmetic and input operations.\n",
    "Robustness: The code safely handles invalid inputs and prevents crashes using exception handling.\n",
    "Readability: The structure is clear, well-commented, and easy to follow. Variable names and print statements make the flow understandable to me.\n",
    "Faithfulness: It follows the structure and concepts from Python Programming Lesson 2, especially in using input(), float().\n",

    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Discussion: \n",
    "try/except is better than str.isdigit() because it works for any number, including negatives (-5) and floats (3.14).\n",
    "isdigit() only returns True for whole positive numbers with digits only. Using try/except with float() \n",
    "handles all valid numeric input and prevents errors safely, which makes it more reliable for arithmetic operations and user input validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "You’re being asked to **simulate dice rolls** to estimate (not calculate exactly) the **probability** that the **sum of two dice equals 7**.\n",

    "A die has 6 sides numbered 1–6.\n",
    "You can simulate this in Python with:\n",

    "You’ll repeat the experiment **100,000 times** to estimate how often the sum is 7.\n",
    "This uses the **Monte Carlo** approach — doing many random trials to get a statistical estimate.\n",
